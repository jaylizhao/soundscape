Looking back, one thing I could have done better is making sure my implementation directly addressed the core of the GitHub issue as it was described. The way I approached the problem focused on re-displaying the onboarding language selection screen if the app's language and the device language didn’t match. However, after re-reading the issue, I feel like the original request may have been looking for something slightly different.
The issue seemed to ask for the app to automatically switch to the device language (when supported) at launch if the user hadn’t already selected a language. It does not necessarily ask to re-trigger the onboarding language selection menu. In my implementation, I chose to bring the onboarding screen back in cases of mismatch, but that adds an additional step when opening the app and may not be what the original issue intended.
In hindsight, a better approach may have been to check for a mismatch at launch and, if the user’s chosen language from the start now differed, to automatically set the app’s language to match the device silently and without interrupting the user while still offering a manual option to change it during onboarding. I feel like if I revisited the issue, I would possibly adjust the logic so that it’s more seamless and better aligned with the initial request.
This experience reminded me how important it is to carefully interpret GitHub issues and clarify the intent if something’s ambiguous. A brief discussion or question in the issue thread might have saved time and ensured a more accurate solution from the start.
